<!-- Very simple FEU sample. The goal of this sample is to demonstrate a 
	very simple FEU ruleset. When the ruleset activates, we create a picture 
	just off the right edge of the screen and start sliding it left. As soon 
	as the image is fully on-screen, we start the next one, also sliding to the 
	left. When each image goes off the left side of the screen, it self-destructs. 
	Also demonstrates the "Screen" object external reference. -->
